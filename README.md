## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Typescript
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Another project done with React, Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. I added an intermediate layout for tablets and an error message if the link is invalid. When resizing the screen, I made the mobile menu close, and saw that the eventListener was being called multiple times as I resized the screen. To solve that, whenever I resize the screen, the mobile menu closes and the eventListener is removed. If I open the mobile menu again, the eventListener is added again. Feedback is welcome!
